# Contributing to Fluux Messenger

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Fluux Messenger!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust (for Tauri desktop builds)
- npm

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/processone/fluux-messenger.git
cd fluux-messenger

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the SDK (required before running the app)
npm run build:sdk

# Start development server (web)
npm run dev

# Start development server (desktop)
npm run tauri:dev
```

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Build to verify no errors
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug description"
git commit -m "docs: update documentation"
git commit -m "test: add tests for feature"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

- Push your branch to GitHub
- Open a Pull Request against `main`
- Fill in the PR template
- Wait for CI checks to pass

### 6. Merge

- PRs are squash-merged to keep history clean
- Each PR becomes a single commit on main

## Code Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### SDK Design

The SDK (`packages/fluux-sdk`) should:
- Be framework-agnostic where possible
- Expose a clean public API via `index.ts`
- Handle all XMPP protocol details internally
- Apps should never import from `@xmpp/client` directly

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use Vitest for testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Test files go next to source files (`*.test.ts`)

## Branching Strategy

### Feature Development

1. Create a feature or fix branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix
   ```

2. Open a Pull Request against `main`

3. After review, merge to `main` (squash merge)

### Releases

- When ready to release, tag directly on `main`:
  ```bash
  git tag -a v0.9.0 -m "Release v0.9.0"
  git push origin v0.9.0
  ```

### Hotfixes

If a critical fix is needed for a released version:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/0.9.1 v0.9.0
   ```

2. Apply the fix and tag:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: critical bug description"
   git tag -a v0.9.1 -m "Release v0.9.1"
   git push origin v0.9.1
   ```

3. Merge the fix back to `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/0.9.1
   ```
